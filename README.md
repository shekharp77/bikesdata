## General Information
- We have a dataset of a renting bike company which we will use for modelling and predections.
- The business wants to analyze the usage of their services(bikes) by changing the factors. They wants to understand how diff factors changes the usage of their services.
- We have BoomBikes data for this project.


## Conclusions
- We have find out the variables which affects the usage most, like weather, temp etc.
-  We were also able to train our linear regression model with r2 score of above 80%


## Technologies Used
- pandas 
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy
